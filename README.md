# Deep-Learning-with-Pytorch
This is a Repo with deep learning projects made by pytorch.The projects are on two ML Subbranches: Regression and Classification
Included are some AI projects including Natural Language Processing. Other neural networks include RNN ,GRU and LSTM for the Forecasting Problems
